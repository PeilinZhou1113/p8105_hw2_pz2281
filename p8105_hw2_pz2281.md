## Problem 1

Read in Mr.Trash Wheel data

Tidy Mr.Trash Wheel dataset

``` r
trash_wheel_df = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/Trash_Wheel.xlsx", range = "A2:N406") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
```

Import and tidy precipitation data for 2018 and 2019

``` r
pre_2018 = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/Trash_Wheel.xlsx", sheet = 5, range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2018")

pre_2019 = 
  readxl::read_excel("./data/Trash_Wheel.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:B8") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2019")
```

Combine data

``` r
 tidy_pre = 
  bind_rows(pre_2018,pre_2019) %>% 
  relocate(year) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

Data Summaries

The Mr.Trash Wheel dataset contains litter data for total of 344
dumpsters through 6 years. There are 14 variables in this dataset. For
all of the dumpsters, the average number of plastic bottles they
received through the five-year span is 1873 and the average number of
cigarette butts is 3.0754^{4}. The amount of total litter that that
trash wheel had collected in 5 years is 1122.45 tons.

The number of observation is 12 for the 2018 precipitation data and 6
for the 2019 data. Both datasets have 3 variables, including month,
year, and precipitation amount in inches. The total amount of
precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches and the average amount was
5.8608333 inches. The total amount of precipitation in 2019 (data for 6
months) was 16.67 inches and the median was 3.34 inches. The conmbined
dataset contains precipitation data for both 2018 and 2019. The total
amount of precipitation was 87 and the average was 4.8333333.

## Problem 2

Import and tidy pols-month data

``` r
pols_month =
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month","day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  mutate(month = as.numeric(month)) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  mutate(president = ifelse(prez_gop == 1, "gop", "dem")) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem,-prez_gop,-day)
```

Import and tidy snp data

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("year","month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% 
  arrange(year,month) %>% 
  relocate(year,month)
```

Import and tidy unemployment data

``` r
unemp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment") %>% 
  mutate(month = match(month,month.abb)) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```
